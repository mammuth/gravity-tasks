# Agent Workflow Rules

## Plan Hygiene
- Update `PLAN.md` after meaningful, larger changes or features.
- Keep "Still To Do" current; move items to "Done" only for larger/complex work.
- Preserve a running history in "Done"; do not delete entries.

## Execution Rules
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Ask one focused question if blocked.

## Status Reporting
- After each larger/complex change, state which PLAN items moved to Done.
